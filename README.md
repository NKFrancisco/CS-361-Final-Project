# CS 361 - Race Tracks of America
REACT web app utilizing microservices architecture for Software Engineering I final project <br />
Grade Recieved: A

## How to Install 
Using a CLI goto the directories for app-rest and app-ui and run the command npm install in both directories to install the node modules and their dependncies. Then run the command npm start in both directories to start the Express server and React app. 

The web app will run locally on port 8000, with the server listening on port 3000

## Assignment Info
You'll be designing and implementing software that uses the microservices architecture. In this architecture, software is split into multiple small programs that run in different processes. Each small program---or "service"---is a black box; perhaps Service A has a function named "convertCurrency", but Service B cannot see that and directly call that function. Service B can only make an indirect request to use that function, using the format required by Service A. We'll learn more about that.

The individual project you create for this course will use a service created by your partner and their individual project will use a service you create. Before you begin your course project, you'll implement a basic microservices project as a warm-up. In summary, you'll be coding:

1. A microservices warm-up to get used to the microservices concept,
2. An individual project that must use a service provided by a partner, and
3. A service that must be used by a partner as part of their individual project.

Here's a high-level overview of what you'll be doing this term for the project:

Sprint 1: Plan and design UI for individual project, plan first individual project milestone, implement first individual project milestone <br />
Sprint 2: Decide who will implement what service and how the projects/services will be connected, research microservices, plan microservice, implement microservice <br />
Sprint 3: Integrate with partner's project, evaluate code quality, revise (refactor), complete portfolio project <br />
